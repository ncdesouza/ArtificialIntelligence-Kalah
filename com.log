Hey Nick, hows it going?, you on skype?

peter my number is 647 274 0204 

im going home now.. I made some changes and integrated the systems. 

I have some scripts that will compile and run the program.

I have not finished the install script which will install all dependencies.

Try to compile and run it. You may be able to fix the dependencies easily.. if not let me know.

*************************************************************************************************

wow man good job; you're a beast

I tried getting it to compile but when using the scipts i ran into a binary operator expected 
error and since i dont know scrips that well im not sure how to fix it, but im free all day 
tomorrow and all day monday to work on it, matt could prob help us soon too, so just let me 
know what you want to do, i can also come into school if need be.
