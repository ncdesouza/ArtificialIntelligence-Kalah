Hey Nick, hows it going?, you on skype?

peter my number is 647 274 0204 

im going home now.. I made some changes and integrated the systems. 

I have some scripts that will compile and run the program.

I have not finished the install script which will install all dependencies.

Try to compile and run it. You may be able to fix the dependencies easily.. if not let me know.
